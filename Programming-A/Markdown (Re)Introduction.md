# Headings
We create headings in Markdown using hash (#) symbols
To create subheadings, we can use multiple hash symbols
## This is a level 2 subheading
### This is a level 3 subheading
###### This is a level 6 subheading

# Modifying Text Style
## Bold and Italics
We use asterisks (\*) to modify text styling, specifically
bold and italics

e.g.
I want this **word** specifically to be bold
I want this *word* to be italicized
I want this ***word*** to be both bold and italicized

## Escape characters
**ASIDE**: If we want to place a character that is a *keyword* or
*reserved word*, and we want the LITERAL character, use
the back slash (\\)
	e.g. if we want to put an asterisk, we do this \\\*

## ~~Strikethrough~~
We can also strikethrough characters using the tilde (~)
I want to strikethrough this specific ~~word~~
~~This sentence is struck through~~
# Links
We can link things in our Markdown files
[One tool to use.](https://chat.openai.com)
Exercise:
* if you have an openai account, do the following:
	* ask chatgpt to create for you markdown code that is a link to two websites of your choice
* if you don't have chatgpt/openai, create two links to websites of your choice in the space below

e.g. [My favourite website right now](https://nyt.com)

e.g. if you use openai
Put in their code, and in italics say that it's from chatgpt
[A search engine](https://google.com) *from chatgpt*

```markdown
1. [Google](https://google.com)
2. [Steveston-London Secondary School](https://slss.sd38.bc.ca)
*from chatgpt*
```
