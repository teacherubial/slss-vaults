# Headings
The way we create headings is using the hash symbol (#)

If we want to create a different "level" of heading, we use
multiple hashes

## Subheading: level 2
### Subheading: level 3

# Text Modification
## Bold and Italics
We use asterisks to change how text looks with bold and italics

This specific **word** is bold
This specific *word* is italicized
This specific ***word*** is both bold and italicized
